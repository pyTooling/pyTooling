Visibility
##########

The :py:mod:`pyTooling.Decorators` package provides decorators to control the visibility of classes and functions
defined in a module.

export
******

The :py:func:`~pyTooling.Decorators.export` decorator makes module's entities (classes and functions) publicly visible.
Therefore, these entities get registered in the module's variable ``__all__``.

Besides making these entities accessible via ``from foo import *``, Sphinx extensions like autoapi are reading
``__all__`` to infer what entities from a module should be auto documented.

.. admonition:: ``module.py``

   .. code:: python

      # Creating __all__ is only required, if variables need to be listed too
      __all__ = ["MY_CONST"]

      # Decorators can't be applied to fields, so it was manually registered in __all__
      MY_CONST = 42

      @export
      class MyClass:
        """This is a public class."""

      @export
      def myFunc():
        """This is a public function."""

      # Each application of "@export" will append an entry to __all__

.. admonition:: ``application.py``

   .. code:: python

      from .module import *

      inst = MyClass()
