      A warning can be raised similar to an exception, but it doesn't interrupt execution at the position where it was
      raised. The warning travels upwards the call-stack until it's handled by a :class:`~pyTooling.Warning.WarningCollector`
      similar to a `try .. except` statement. If a warning isn't handled within the call-stack, it raises an exception.

      A warning is raised by Calling the class-method :meth:`WarningCollector.Raise <pyTooling.Warning.WarningCollector.Raise>`.
      This function expects a single parameter: an instance of :class:`Warning`.

      To handle a raised warning, a `with`-statement is used to collect raised warnings. Usually, a list is handed over
      to a :class:`~pyTooling.Warning.WarningCollector` context.

             with WarningCollector(warnings) as warning:
               a.methA()
