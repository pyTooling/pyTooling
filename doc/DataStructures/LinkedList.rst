.. rubric:: Doubly Linked List Properties:

* The LinkedList counts the number of elements.
* The LinkedList has a reference to the first and last element in the doubly linked list.
* Each Node has a linked to its previous Node and its next Node (doubly linked).
* Each Node has a link to its LinkedList.
* Each Node has a value.
* Operations can be performed in the LinkedList or on any Node.
* The LinkedList can be iterated in ascending and descending order.
* The list can be iterated starting from any Node.

.. danger::

   Accessing internal fields of a doubly linked list or node is strongly not recommended for users, as it might lead to
   a corrupted data structure. If a power-user wants to access these fields, feel free to use them for achieving a
   higher performance, but you got warned ðŸ˜‰.
