"""
Data models of continuous integration services.

A model reads a service's REST payloads into objects with a parent-child relation, so a consumer works with named
attributes and typed enumerations instead of nested dictionaries and magic strings. The models carry no dependency on
what is done with them - rendering, tracing or reporting are consumers of a model, not part of it.
