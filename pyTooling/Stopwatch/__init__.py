	The stopwatch implements a solution to measure and collect timings.

	The time measurement can be started, paused, resumed and stopped. More over, split times can be taken too. The
	measurement is based on :func:`time.perf_counter_ns`. Additionally, starting and stopping is preserved as absolute
	time via :meth:`datetime.datetime.now`.

	Every split time taken is a time delta to the previous operation. These are preserved in an internal sequence of
	splits. This sequence includes time deltas of activity and inactivity. Thus, a running stopwatch can be split as well
	as a paused stopwatch.

	The stopwatch can also be used in a :ref:`with-statement <with>`, because it implements the :ref:`context manager protocol <context-managers>`.
